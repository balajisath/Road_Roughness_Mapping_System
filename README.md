# Road Roughness Mapping System

This is our senior design project completed over two semesters of an academic year. The code and information in this repository represents the work done in the machine/deep learning team of the project.

## Project Overview

Many roads in Boston are littered with potholes, remnants of poor repair work, and generally rough surfaces. As a result, vehicle drivers are burdened with huge damage costs and the suspension/bumper of vehicles face significant damages. Vehicle drivers and pedestrians are injured and fatal accidents occur in some cases as well. This calls for a smart system which would grade road roughness and provide the relevant pothole information to the user. The final deliverable will be a system that comprises an application, sensors, machine learning code, and a cloud service which work together to give the user a safe driving experience.
