# Inception V3 Binary Classifier

The Inception V3 neural network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. I have used this model for classifying images as having potholes (positive) or not (negative).

The following two datasets were used for training. The two sets were concatenated to create a larger dataset. The combined data set contains 10,662 training images, 1184 validation images, and 984 testing images. A few samples from the training set are shown below. Both the datasets were generated by the same person for a paper. The images were collected by mounting a camera on the vehicleâ€™s dashboard. The images (RGB) are rescaled (480x640) using the image_dataset_from_directory function offered by Keras.
